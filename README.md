# NN-Numerical-vs-Backprop

This project demonstrates two methods of training a neural network using the MNIST dataset: numerical differentiation and backpropagation. It includes the implementation of both methods, allowing users to switch between them and observe the differences in training efficiency and accuracy.

## Getting Started

### Preparing the MNIST Data

You need to download the MNIST dataset manually and place the files in the same directory as this project. 

Download the dataset from [here]([http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv?select=mnist_train.csv)).

Download the following files:
- `mnist_train.csv`
- `mnist_test.csv`

Extract the files and place them in the same directory as this project.

Once the files are placed correctly, you can run the project.
